					<h1>Connect 4 java project</h1>
					<h4><a href="https://github.com/KunoDLK/Website"><u>Source Code here</u></a></h4>
				</header>
				<p>As a part of my computer science A-Level I had to make a java project called the "NEA" (no idea what
					that stands for). The NEA is worth 20% of my final grade so it's esential to work hard on it and get
					a good grade for it. Thankfully I did the majory of the coding during my summer holiday leaving me
					to gradually finish it over my final year without a final rush to finish it.</p>
				<P>This is my largest project to date with +300hrs of work that has gone into coding this. However it is
					my first full size coding project so I am sure that if I were to redo it, it would only take me
					50hrs or so, but hey I enjoyed every minute of it so I'm not complaining.</P>
				<h2>The AIM:</h2>
				<p>I had the flexibility to make any project I wanted within reason (Thank you teacher). Choosing the
					right project is very important for somthing that's supposed to show your ability. Too hard and you
					don't finish, but too easy it's too simple. In the end I chose Connect 4 because with this game I
					can create the simple game easily but then I can make an AI oponent that can be as complex as I have
					time for.</p>
				<p>There was quite a few hoops that I had to jump through because it was a school project but to make
					this a fun story I am just going to talk about the intersting coding and the funny bugs that
					happened.</p>
				<p>(I wanted to do a 2D light ray tracer which I still would like to do in the future but not a good
					thing for my first project)</p>
				<h2>Part 1, Making The Base game:</h2>
				<p>If you don't know what Connect 4 is then fine I will explain:</p>
				<p>Connect 4 is two player game where each player takes it in turn to drop their counter in to the
					vertical board. The aim of the game is to get 4 counters in a row (horizontal, vertical or
					diagonally)</p>
				<h3>Time To Start Coding:</h3>
				<p>To start things off I used a 2D array of strings as the game board data type so I could easly print
					the board to the console. I then wrote a simple algorithm for placing the counter in the lowest
					posible cell (To emulate gravity). Did it work first time? Of course not but with a nice helping of
					debuging the simple game was working. The game didn't know if someone wins and crashed if you try to
					do anything not intended, But that is fine at this point.</p>
				<h2>Part 2, Making The Game winnable:</h2>
				<p> First off I needed to know if a player has won or not. So I write an algorithm that looks at every
					counter and every direction around it to see if there is 4 counters in a row. This is the algorthm I
					came up with:</p>
				<pre><code>for every column on the board
	for: every counter in this column
		store the "counter type" at this position
		for: every positive direction
			start a "chain length" counter
			while: this counter type = "counter type"
				step forward in that direction on board
				if: this counter type = "counter type"
					increase the counter
				else:
					break out of while loop
			move back to starting position
			invert the direction
			while: this counter type = "counter type"
				step forward in that direction on board
				if: this counter type = "counter type"
					increase the counter
				else:
					break out of while loop
			if: "chain length" >= 4
				return "counter type"
return null</code></pre>
				<p>Now armed with this algorithm I am able to detect win/loss. So I added it to the main game loop so
					the
					game will end when someone wins. After a good time in the "debug zone" the orginal game with two
					players works and I now have to figure out how to make a game AI.</p>
				<h2>Part 3, Making A Game AI:</h2>
				<p>Now using my fine research skills on the perfect algorithm for my AI. I searched long and hard and in
					the end I decided on the MiniMax algorithm.</p>
				<div class="image main"><img src="../images/NEA_research.png" alt="" /></div>
				<p>The interesting part of the minimax algorithm is that is assumes that the opponent is perfect.
					However, the opponent in this case is a human and unfortunately humans are not perfect (Programmers
					use debuggers for a reason). This will make the AI do seemingly random moves, however this is
					not the case. It is comprehending more than our human minds can.</p>
				<p>This high level comes at a large cost, computation time. Each move has 7 possibilities so if I want
					to compute 3 moves ahead.</p>
				<header class="major">
					<h3>#outcomes = 7^3 = 343</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Ok cool, 343 that’s not that many a computer could crunch those number in a blink of an eye. Now
					let’s
					say that I find the AI too easy so I double the amount of moves ahead that it calculates. How many
					moves do you think it has to calculate now? 2 Times the amount? 4 Times?</p>
				<header class="major">
					<h4>*Calculator clicking* 7^6 *presses enter* =117,649</h4>
				</header>
				<p>117,649!!! That is 343 times more! The reason for this is because of the Big O notation of with
					algorithm is O(n!). To put this in perspective I times one number by 2, the program goes from a
					blink of an eye to 8 seconds of waiting.</p>
				<p>So what is the solution to the problem? (I hear you ask in my imagination). Hold your horses, queue
					the
					next section...</p>
				<h2>The next section: Multithreading</h2>
				<p>There are many elegent ways of improving the basic minimax algorithm. However...I wanted to try
					Multithreading (when I told my teacher this he laughed and said, "good luck").</p>
				<p>At this point I had a for loop that runs the MiniMax algorithm on each posible move. So I decided to
					attempt to multi thread the program at this point. The reason for this is that the for loop was
					doing
					the exact same thing 7 times over so I could split the program to do the 7 things at the same time.
				</p>
				<p>To be honest at this point I had no idea what I was doing so I had to watch several Java
					Multithreading tutorials on youtube. In the end I had an "ok" undersanding on Multithreading and I
					started to transfer the MiniMax algorithm. Used two counters on for the number of threads that have
					started and one for the number that have finished. I can use the difference between these two
					numbers
					to calculate the number of currently running threads. I used this with a basic if statement to limit
					the number of concurent threads to a number so my processor wouldn't get overwhelmed with work.</p>

				<p>I used the <code>implements Runnable</code> built in to Java, after an hour it turns out I only
					needed 3
					lines in the <code>run()</code> subroutine:</p>
				<pre><code>public void run() {
       
	// Runs the mini max algorthm
	scores[Integer.valueOf(node)] = 
	minimax(node, game_Board, stack_Array, depth, isMaximizingPlayer);
		
	// Adds up the total number considered
	totalConsidered += considered;
		
	// incress the thread completed counter
	ThreadsCompleted++;
}</code></pre>
				<p>This class extends the main AI class that keeps track of the amount of threads completed. This means
					this class can directly access the counter.</p>
				<h2>Concusion</h2>
				<p>So I finished it (yay), and it works. Unfortunately I can't beat it. For those speed concerns,
					typically on my average laptop the program can
					calculate 7 moves ahead in under a second. I tried playing my program against the worlds best and it
					lost,
					but two moves before the end there was level playing. So I am very happy.</p>
				<p>I enjoyed writing this so much I can't wait for my next project. You can find the source code <a
						href="https://github.com/KunoDLK/Website"><u>here</u></a>
					and don't forget "Instant isn't a coffee", have a great day.</p>
