					<h1>torch mk1</h1>
				</header>
				<h2>The Plan:</h2>
				<p>OK, this was very fun, was and still is my favorite project. There is something about holding a
					device that is 100 times more powerful then you have ever held.</p>
				<p>This project started with me watching DIY perks’ "Make a 1000w equiv. LED flashlight - aka DIY
					Sun-Blaster!" video. In the video he made a torch that used a 100W LED and a CPU heat sink. credit
					to him his design was simple, powerful and above all else cheap.</p>
				<p>I grabbed an old-fashioned pencil and graph paper and designed my torch. I added A/C powered
					charging, automatic power switching that reroutes the lights power from the battery to the power
					supply when charging via relay logic. After 10 minutes and a generous helping of over engineering I
					found myself with this:</p>
				<div class="image main"><img src="images/Torchmk1_Blueprint.png" alt="" /></div>
				<h2>The Buy</h2>
				<p>Next I did the next logical thing that any of my teenage friends who are girls would do in a
					heartbeat, shopping. But not the teenage girl kind. To cut this year long project story short. I
					found all the parts I needed on eBay and Amazon, wasn't hard at all. However, there is problem with
					eBay/amazon li-ion batteries. I didn't want to get scammed with rubbish batteries that turned my
					house into the memorial my house once stood. In the end I found <a
						href="https://www.nkon.nl/">nkon.nl</a> which was an honest Dutch battery distributor. I went
					with Samsung's INR18650-30Q with 3Ah (300mAh) of charge and a continuous discharge of 15A. I used 4
					of them in series to give me 14.4v @ 15A for 3Ah, this totals to 216W (max) for 43Whr. </p>
				<p>Side note: honestly, I feel sorry for the lass that I will (hopefully and or eventually) find because
					this is shopping not any outfit nonsense.</p>
				<p>In summary for the parts, the only thing that was sketchy was the power supply which was a 12v 200W
					PSU. It worked fine and I even had a look on the inside it had 6+ grounding points on the PCB that
					contact the grounded chassis and had A+ AC/DC isolation (Back in Black is my favourite). but it had
					wire terminals, so I had to work with a death cable (what, you don't know what that is? It’s a power
					cord with exposed live, neutral and depending on your country ground wires).</p>
				<p>"A/C and Lithium battery? Don't you think that's a bad idea?" I hear you think. Well yes, I have
					never powered up the torch with AC apart from on a safe workbench with absolutely nobody in the
					danger zone (exclude the joke about the song because I am trying to make a serious point). Don't
					mess with A/C power unless you are a pro, or you put the right precautions in place and know what
					you are doing. In the end, I did not include an A/C plug on my torch as it's dangerous and I'm quite
					fond of living. </p>
				<h2>The build:</h2>
				<p>The heat sink and LED arrived the next day because Amazon prime is awesome. Putting the two together
					was surprisingly easy. Like cheese on toast, I had to make zero hack modifications to the heat sink
					to get the two introduced. Even the hole in the bottom bracket was perfectly big (hey, I’m a glass
					half full guy). The next day a voltage regulator came in the post, within 5 minutes I had both the
					fan and LED hooked up.</p>
				<p>Testing time (my power supply only goes up to 31V so this test is at half power).:</p>
				<div class="image main"><img src="images/Torchmk1_outside_Test.jpg" alt="" /></div>
				<p>The next lot of parts that arrived were to do with the battery. I’m not going to lie it’s a little
					bit scary working with li-ion batteries. If you get them over 60°C it’s broken. I’m going to use
					350°C solder on them, so I had to be quick. In the end I was very happy with the results. I used
					silver copper wire to connect the batteries together and added a BMS (battery management system) to
					it because these batteries where expensive and I didn’t want to break them:</p>
				<div class="image main"><img src="images/Torchmk1_battery.jpg" alt="" /></div>
				<p>Well it was quite a wait after that until anything else happened. But then something did happen. Once
					I finished recieving all the parts I had to design a circuit board that would bring all the parts
					together. I am going to be honest I should have designed it properly before building it buuuuttt I
					winged it. To be honest it was only relay logic. It wasn’t going to be that hard and it wasn’t, but
					I could’ve been more efficient on space. However, when your torch is 8'' long, space isn't a
					problem.</p>
				<h2>The assemble</h2>
				<p>I went to the nearest material store and picked up an Aluminium angle. With a sharpie in one hand and
					ruler the other I marked out all the cuts I had to make. 5 Minutes and I was done. The cuts on the
					other hand took forever. My hacksaw was very blunt and very short. So around an hour and a half was
					required for this step, but now I have all the parts for the frame:</p>
				<div class="image main"><img src="images/Torchmk1_metal_Cut.jpg" alt="" /></div>
				<p>The rest of the assemble was easy I used rivets and bolts to secure the frame together. To be
					truthful I did not measure the size of the components that needed to go inside of the torch. So
					getting everything inside was a squash but still possible.</p>
				<h2>Summary</h2>
				<p>In summary I have a not so compact torch that Is brighter than anyone ever needs.</p>
				<p>It’s pretty cool though!</p>
