					<h1>CAMBRIGE FAULT LOCALIZER</h1>
					<h2>&numero; L-319880</h2>
				</header>
				<a class="image fit"><img src="../images/vintage/localizer/localizer.jpg" alt="" /></a>
				<p>Here we have the "Cambridge Fault localizer" that I bought for Â£25 on Facebook Market Place.
					To be completely honest I bought it because of how cool it looks without knowing what it's purpose
					is. Who could resist dials and switches in an old wooden box with a leather handle! So I set to work
					investigating. Information on this is little to none. The only two mentions of this online I found
					are:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>An old article that mentions it in passing.</li>
					<li>An archiving company holding something related to it.</li>
				</ol>
				<p><span class="image right"><img src="../images/vintage/localizer/warranty-seal.jpeg"
							alt="" /></span>So I did the only logical thing, take it apart and find out how it works.
					However, I instantly ran into a problem. The main unit was held in place by 4 threaded standofs and
					4 nuts. That was not the problem, the issue was a lead warranty-seal stamped with the logo,
					personally I
					find that so cool. Wanting to preserve this old bit of tech I removed the warranty-seal as carefuly
					as possible. Turns out a lead warranty seal works realy well, there is no way it could have been
					removed without scratching/deforming it (Scroll to the bottom for my comment on working with lead*).
					After removing the 4 nuts, the whole
					electrical unit pulled out of it's lovely wooden case (I wish changing my phone battery was this
					easy). The inside was disscusting so I gave it all a good clean up, gave the wood some care with
					furniture polish and used brasso on the brass</p>

				<p>So after a little investigation I figured out what is does. The device measures a section of
					wire and the user specifies what percentage of the wire that is being tested. The device then
					calculates the resistance for the whole wire with nothing but wire wound resistors and switches.
					Amazing! I'm still not sure what industry this was used in or how old it is. So do send me an e-mail if you have any further information on it. Meanwhile, I shall carry on researching. </p>

				<p>*lead is poisonous and just a tiny bit of it in you can cause weakness, brain damage and death.
					Therfore, I always wash my hands after working with these devices. It never hurts to be overly
					cautious.</p>
