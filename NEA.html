					<h1>Connect 4 java project</h1>
				</header>
				<p>As a part of my computer science A-Level I had to make a java project called the "NEA" (no idea what
					that stands for). The NEA is worth 20% of my final grade so it's esential to work hard on it and get
					a good grade for it. Thankfully I did the majory of the coding during my summer holiday leaving me
					to gradually finish it over my final year without a final rush to finish it.</p>
				<P>This is my largest project to date with +300hrs of work that has gone into coding this. However it is
					my first full size coding project so I am sure that if I were to redo it, it would only take me
					50hrs or so, but hey I enjoyed every minute of it so I'm not complaining.</P>
				<h2>The AIM:</h2>
				<p>I had the flexibility to make any project I wanted within reason (Thank you teacher). Choosing the
					right project is very important for somthing that's supposed to show your ability. Too hard and you
					don't finish, but too easy it's too simple. In the end I chose Connect 4 because with this game I
					can create the simple game easily but then I can make an AI oponent that can be as complex as I have
					time for.</p>
				<p>There was quite a few hoops that I had to jump through because it was a school project but to make
					this a fun story I am just going to talk about the intersting coding and the funny bugs that
					happened.</p>
				<p>(I wanted to do a 2D light ray tracer which I still would like to do in the future but not a good
					thing for my first project)</p>
				<h2>Part 1, Making The Base game:</h2>
				<p>If you don't know what Connect 4 is then fine I will explain:</p>
				<p>Connect 4 is two player game where each player takes it in turn to drop their counter in to the
					vertical board. The aim of the game is to get 4 counters in a row (horizontal, vertical or
					diagonally)</p>
				<h3>Time To Start Coding:</h3>
				<p>To start things off I used a 2D array of strings as the game board data type so I could easly print
					the board to the console. I then wrote a simple algorithm for placing the counter in the lowest
					posible cell (To emulate gravity). Did it work first time? Of course not but with a nice helping of
					debuging the simple game was working. The game didn't know if someone wins and crashed if you try to
					do anything not intended, But that is fine at this point.</p>
				<h2>Part 2, Making The Game winnable:</h2>
				<p> First off I needed to know if a player has won or not. So I write an algorithm that looks at every
					counter and every direction around it to see if there is 4 counters in a row. This is the algorthm I
					came up with:</p>
				<pre><code>for every column on the board
	for: every counter in this column
		store the "counter type" at this position
		for: every positive direction
			start a "chain length" counter
			while: this counter type = "counter type"
				step forward in that direction on board
				if: this counter type = "counter type"
					increase the counter
				else:
					break out of while loop
			move back to starting position
			invert the direction
			while: this counter type = "counter type"
				step forward in that direction on board
				if: this counter type = "counter type"
					increase the counter
				else:
					break out of while loop
			if: "chain length" >= 4
				return "counter type"
return null</code></pre>
				<p>Now armed with this algorithm I am able to detect win/loss. So add it to the main game loop so the
					game will end when someone wins. After a good time in the "debug zone" the orginal game with two
					players works and I now have to figure out how to make a game AI</p>
				<h2>Part 3, Making A Game AI:</h2>
				<p>Now using my fine research skills on the perfect algorithm for my AI. I searched long and hard and in
					the end I decided on the MiniMax algorithm</p>
